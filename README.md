# Getting started -

1. Firstly run the command ``npm i``
2. Then create a file called `.env` ( you can just edit the `.example.env` file to read `.env` )
3. Fill out the required fills in the `.env` file ( ``token``, ``clientID``, ``guildID`` and ``devID`` )
4. You can then edit the `config.js` file to have a different config e.g. different embed colors, emojis and more...
5. That should be it, run ``node .`` and the bot should run
